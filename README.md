# simple-java-swing-animator
Tools for animating JComponents.

Uses Java Swing Timer to animate JComponent from A to B. 

Straight Animation: animates in one dimension (x or y), can feature smooth ending.

Cross Animation [BETA]: animates in x and y at once. Still in beta, does not feature smooth ending.
